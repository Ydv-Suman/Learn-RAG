These models are typically based on deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, and are capable of processing and generating vast amounts of text data. Large language models have many applications, including text generation, language translation, and natural language understanding. Examples of large language models include GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 99, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-Cn7qcmK9Th100ZXgZB2Ch3i7Wx6tR', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b2354-1faf-7382-99b1-40101126163e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 99, 'total_tokens': 111, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
