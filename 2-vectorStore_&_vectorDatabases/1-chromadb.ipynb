Examples of large language models include GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 99, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 111, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-Cn7qcmK9Th100ZXgZB2Ch3i7Wx6tR', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b2354-1faf-7382-99b1-40101126163e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 99, 'total_tokens': 111, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
