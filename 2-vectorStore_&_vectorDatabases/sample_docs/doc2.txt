Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables
computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.
NLP combines linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to process text and speech data.

Common NLP applications include chatbots, search engines, sentiment analysis,
text summarization, and machine translation.
