Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks,
often called deep neural networks, to model complex patterns in large datasets.
These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and are particularly
effective when working with large amounts of unstructured data.

Deep learning is widely used in image recognition, speech processing,
autonomous systems, and natural language understanding.
