Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems
that can learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
Instead of following fixed rules, machine learning models improve their performance as they are exposed
to more data over time.

Common types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
and reinforcement learning. These techniques are widely used in recommendation systems,
fraud detection, and predictive analytics.
